# Instagram Clone

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a web-based clone of Instagram using HTML and CSS. The primary components of the clone include:

- **Sidebar**: A simple sidebar featuring icons and a list structure using `<ul>` and `<li>` tags. This element is styled using CSS to fix its position and maintain its width.
- **Story Section**: Utilizes Flexbox to display a row of stories. Each story is a combination of an image and text, formatted to appear as circular icons with captions.
- **Posts Section**: Another Flexbox layout that is more intricate. This section displays individual posts with images, user interactions (like, comment, share), and comments.
- **Footer Section**: Contains user details, suggestion lists, and navigational links. Styled to stay at the bottom of the page.
